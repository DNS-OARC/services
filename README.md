# OARC Software Chat

We host a Mattermost chat platform for the DNS Operations Community and OARC
Members, and on it is a channel called "OARC Software".

https://chat.dns-oarc.net/community/channels/oarc-software

This channel can be used to talk about OARC's software and its features, and
for announcements of new releases. It is also a place where you can interact
with others using our software and get help (as a compliment to some of our
mailing lists).
